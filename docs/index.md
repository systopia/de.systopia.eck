# CiviCRM Entity Construction Kit

This extension provides a user interface and an API for creating and managing
CiviCRM entities. In conjunction with custom fields being attached to those
entities, things in your business logic can be modeled more clearly, when
standard CiviCRM entities are not sufficient.

The extension is licensed under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE.txt).
